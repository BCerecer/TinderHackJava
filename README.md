# TinderHackJava

Here is a video of what id does: [Tinder Hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txYjeFRi_LU)

I managed to do some reverse engineering to tinder's api using man-in-the-middle to give some extra features. This project only needs two args, 0 = user's facebook token, 1 = user's facebook ID. It has bot capabilities if you want to spam people. If you are interested in knowing how I did this, and learn how to use this code see visit my blog [bcerecer.com](http://www.bcerecer.com).  Any questions email me.

Some of the features of this project:

1. Send the same message to all your users.
2. Change user's location.
3. Like several amount of users in a matter of seconds.
